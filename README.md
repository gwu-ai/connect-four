# Cross Four
Connect-Four is a game for two players, where the object of the game is to get four or
more pieces of your color in a line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game board
is a grid of spaces for pieces, six high and seven wide.

Pieces are inserted at the top of the game board and fall to the lowest open level in
their column. Players attempt to get four pieces in a row while blocking their opponent
from doing the same. Whoever gets four of their pieces in a line first wins, but if the board
fills, it is a draw.
